/*
 *
 * idea 1: Seaching for non-"." symbols first then check for digits in the 8 adjasent tiles
 * track the position of each digit in a list then bind with connected digits
 * discard numbers with matching start and end positions
 * (similar to how a video game would check for relevant data)
 *  
 * idea 2: Use regex to find position of all digits and symbols
 * then use a position algorithm to determine relevant digits
 * (probably simpler to implement)
 * 
 * Both ideas are similar with the difference being if we wait for gathering the numbers or gather them at the same time as the symbols.
 * The difference between the two ideas depending entirely on how big the input is and how many "lonely" symbols and digits there are.
 * 
 * idea 3: What about linear search, or "doing it the hard way"?
 * More control over data gathering, but also needing to spend time finding out how to identify line breaks.
 * 
 * Reflection 1: what constitutes a "symbol" is ambigious. Is it anything that is non-alpha-numeric and not part of the english alphabet? 
 * For this exercise I will assume whatever is not defined as a "word character"  by Regex to be good enough for a first pass.
 * 
 * !!!! Reflection 2: !!!!
 * Apparantly, the Regex API for Rust does NOT currently implement a method for getting the character index of a match. 
 * It's not by character count, but by the match count or byte offset from haystack start.
 * Rust bros, I'm sorry but C# still got a leg over us here.
 * So what we then do is .enumerate() on captures_iter then check if 1.capture.get(0) is a number or a symbol. 
 * This is becoming a very ghetto linear search.
